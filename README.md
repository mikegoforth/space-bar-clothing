## About

This app was built over late nights and weekends. Coincidingly, this is the first full blown ecommerce app built specifically demonstrating React. I still have work to do, but I'm happy to share my progress. ✨🛰️

## Built With
* **Libraries:** [React](https://reactjs.org/), [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/)
* **Middlewares:** [Redux Thunk](https://redux.js.org/docs/api/thunk.html), [Redux Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/)
* **Authentication / Database:** [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
* **CI/CD:** [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## Available Scripts

`npm start`

`npm test`

`npm run build`

`npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
